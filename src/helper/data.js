      "All of the firms at the top have fewer than 1,500 properties, while some of the country's biggest cottage rental companies failed to even make the top 10 in a survey, Wales Online reports. The Landmark Trust - a charity that restores old, historical buildings and transforms them into holiday rentals - came out on top.",

    description:'Recently, Cheng J. et al.1 cited and simulated the relative percentage tree cover to interpret the ~3000–4000 years lag between tree cover and East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) rainfall. They concluded that vegetation feedback has caused a lagged ecosystem response to EASM rainfall during the Holocene (11.7–0 ka). Here, we question the feasibility of using the relative percentage tree cover to measure vegetation feedback to climate. First, the land cover in northern China includes forests, grasslands, and bare land2.',

Anthropogenic global sea level rise over the past century has magnified flooding and caused clear-sky floods in many coastal regions around the world3. While much emphasis has been placed on sea level extremes induced by storms and high tides on daily time scales4, sea level extremes driven by climate variability and their evolution under anthropogenic climate change have received less attention.',

    description:'Atlantic hurricane activity experienced a pronounced lull during the 1970s and 1980s. The current explanation that anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing cooled the sea surface locally fails to capture the magnitude of this large decrease in activity. To explain this hurricane drought, we propose that the radiative effects of sulfate aerosols from Europe and North-America decreased precipitation in the Sahara-Sahel region, leading to an enhancement of dust regional emissions and transport over the Atlantic. This dust in turn enhanced the local decrease of sea-surface temperature and of hurricane activity.',
